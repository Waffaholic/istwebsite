	This is the body of my page, It's where important information would go if I had any to put here. Because I have nothing worthwhile to input here I'm just going to insert a video of dancing crabs...
</p>	
<p class="video">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" style="float:center" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDU_Txk06tM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p class="p">
	I would say iframe is easily my favorite html tag. It enables you to do so many different things from embedding YouTube videos to adding games to your website.
</p>
	To avoid clogging up this page I'll put a game embeded on a seperate page <a class="game" href="Joseph Moran Embed.html"> here</a>. It might not run too well on the Pi, but it should run fine on a Windows PC.
<p class="p">
	While html is not ideal for user input and you can't really create programs with it you can gather basic information by using tags such as the form and input tags. I currently do not know how to collect this data so right now there is just an example of what an input would look like.
</p>
<br>
<div class="form">
<form action="Joseph Moran Input.php">
	Full Name: <input type="text" name="fullname">
	<input type="submit" value="Sumbit"
</form>
</div>
<p class="p">
	The final part of html that I will comment on is the class attribute, this attribute lets you organize your code and helps a lot with CSS. Lets say you have 2 p tags and you want to differentiate them in your CSS. You can assign them a class and then write seperate CSS for them.

	At the bottom of this website I have linked a tutorial of how to host your website with Github so you can acess it with any computer on any network.
