		To start the process of hosting your website on GitHub make sure your html file is named index.html. This will let github know what file the main page is.
	</p>
	<img class="git" src="assets\Capture 1.png">
	<p class="p"> 
		Next you need to create an account by going to
			<a class="bottom" href="github.com">
				github.com
			</a>
		.
	</p>	
	<br>
	<img class="git" src="assets\capture 2.png">
	<p class="p">
		After your account is setup and you are logged in go to the top left of the screen, click the plus button and then select "New repository" from the dropdown.
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="git" src="assets\capture 3.png">
	<p class="p">
		Now you need to create a repository name, it can be anything you want. Before pressing create repository make sure to select the "Initialize this repository with README" option.
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="git" src="assets\capture 4.png">
	<p class="p">
		You now need to upload your file, again make sure the html file is named index.html, if it is not this will not work.
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="git" src="assets\capture 5.png">
	<p class="p">
		After uploading your file make sure "Commit directly to master branch" is selected and then click the green "Commit Changes" button.
	</p> 
	<br>
	<img class="git" src="assets\capture 6.png">
	<p class="p">
		Now when back on the main page for your repository navigate to settings.
	</p>
	<br>
	<img class="git" src="assets\capture 7.png">
	<p class="p">
		Finally, scroll down to Github Pages in the options section of the settings. Then set source to master branch, select save, and you will be given a link for your hosted website. You will need to wait around a minute or so for this page to be processed.
